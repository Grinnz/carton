=head1 NAME

Carton::Doc::Bundle - Bundle cached tarballs in vendor/cache

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  carton bundle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command bundles cached tarballs into C<vendor/cache> directory,
so you can deploy on a host without an internet access to CPAN
mirrors.

Bundled modules can be committed to a version control system, or
transferred to another host with scp/rsync etc. to use with C<carton
install --cached>.

This command also creates an experimental fatpacked executable
C<carton> file in C<vendor/bin> directory, to bootstrap the carton
install process on a host without Carton installed. This is considered
experimental, and can be turned off with C<--no-fatpack> option.
